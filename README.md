# Salary Prediction Using Polynomial Regression
A repository containing a salary prediction model implemented using polynomial regression.

## Features
* Salary prediction using polynomial regression
* Utilizes a dataset (dataset.csv) for training and testing the model
* Includes a Python script (13_salary_prediction_using_polynomial_regression.py) and a Jupyter Notebook (13_Salary_prediction_using_POLYNOMIAL_REGRESSION.ipynb) for implementation

## Installation
To use this repository, clone it to your local machine. Check repository files for details on required libraries and dependencies.

## Usage
1. Explore the dataset (dataset.csv) to understand the data used for training and testing the model.
2. Run the Python script (13_salary_prediction_using_polynomial_regression.py) or the Jupyter Notebook (13_Salary_prediction_using_POLYNOMIAL_REGRESSION.ipynb) to execute the model.
